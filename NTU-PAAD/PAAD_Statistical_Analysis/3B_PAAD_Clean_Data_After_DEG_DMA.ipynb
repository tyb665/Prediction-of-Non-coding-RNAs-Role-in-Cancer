    "Following the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated probes (DMAs), we further refined the original expression and methylation matrices to include only the relevant genes and probes. This step ensures that all downstream analyses are focused exclusively on biologically meaningful targets.\n",
